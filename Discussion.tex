\section{Discussion}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Null relationship between CTR and DOI
\item Smaller ratio between unwrapped and wrapped in DOI case than in standard. Indicates light transport is large contribution and only small portion of generated photons contribute to CTR.
\item Agreement with \cite{Bircher_Shao_2012} and \cite{Moses_2001} for polished scintillator crystals. Discuss conclusions drawn.
\item \cite{Yeom_Vinke_Levin_2013} figure 10 showing improvement in CTR with increasing distance from the photodetector -> discuss.
\item Effective refractive index of partially wrapped configuration.
\end{enumerate}
