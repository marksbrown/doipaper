\section{Introduction} 
Determination of the depth of interaction (DOI) is of importance for PET to reduce the cross-section of each scintillator crystal without degrading the overall sensitivity\cite{Moses_2001}\cite{Humm_Rosenfeld_Del_Guerra_2003}. Within monolithic scintillator detectors the same property allows spatial confinement \cite{am_Borghi_Seifert_Schaart_2013}\cite{Maas_Bruyndonckx_Schaart_2012}.

In this paper we explore the relationship between DOI and the timing performance of two scintillator crystals; Namely a $2\times2\times30$mm$^3$ Proteus LYSO:Ce and $2\times2\times20$mm$^3$ Ca-co-doped LSO:Ce. We begin by a description of the experimental method followed by an analysis of results collected.
