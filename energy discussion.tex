In figures \ref{fig:energyresolution} and \ref{fig:lightoutput} we can see the energy resolution and right photopeak centroid of the scintillator detector with DOI. The latter corresponds to the absolute light output arriving at the photodetector. We first notice that the wrapped measurements show a systematic variation in the photopeak centroid, most likely due to differences in wrapping or coupling. Interestingly this pattern is also observed in figure \ref{fig:ctrvsdoi} showing a poorer CTR for reduced light output as we would expect. Next we notice that the light output is about 20\% higher in the wrapped configuration with a minor drop off in both configurations with increasing DOI. We attribute this to longer path lengths through the scintillator crystal at higher DOI and therefore a greater chance of bulk or surface absorption. In all measurements the energy resolution is seen to be at it's poorest for low DOI values, despite a weak variation seen in the light output. This indicates a broadening of the photopeak at low DOI values as no large change in the absolute light output is observed. Given that this broadening occurs only at low DOI this implies the cause is due to the increased solid angle of generated light reaching the photodetector without interacting with the side faces.
