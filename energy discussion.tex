In figures \ref{fig:energyresolution} and \ref{fig:lightoutput} we can see the energy performance of the scintillator detector with DOI. We define the energy resolution as
\begin{align}
\sigma_E = \frac{\Delta E}{E}
\end{align}
where $\Delta E$ is the FWHM of the photopeak with centroid $E$. The energy resolution is typically given as percentage.
