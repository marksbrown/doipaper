In figures \ref{fig:energyresolution-20} and \ref{fig:lightoutput-20} we see the energy resolution and light output of the 20mm measurements with DOI. As expected the wrapped measurements demonstrate the poorest energy resolution and the highest light output.  At low DOI the energy resolution is at its poorest and the light output is at its highest, regardless of configuration. This implies light transport through the scintillator crystal leads to losses. The unwrapped configuration shows the largest drop in light output with DOI, indicating photons are lost. Similarly in the partially wrapped configuration light is lost at increasing DOI. We conclude the predominant loss of light is scattered light leaving through the face opposite the photodetector.
