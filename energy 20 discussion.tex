In figures \ref{fig:energyresolution-20} and \ref{fig:lightoutput-20} we see the energy resolution and light output of the 20 mm measurements with DOI. As expected the wrapped measurements demonstrate the lowest energy resolution and the highest light output.  At low DOI the energy resolution is at its poorest and the light output is at its highest, regardless of configuration. This implies light transport through the scintillator crystal leads to losses. The unwrapped configuration shows the largest drop in light output with DOI. Similarly in the partially wrapped configuration light is lost at increasing DOI. We conclude the predominant loss of light in both configurations is scattered light leaving through the face opposite the photodetector.
