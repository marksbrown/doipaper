The standard timing coincidence apparatus is altered to utilise electronic collimation for determination of the depth-of-interaction (DOI) contribution upon the timing performance of a scintillator detector. No relationship the coincidence time resolution (CTR) with DOI is observed for multiple materials, wrapping and geometries. It is shown that DOI information can reduce the CTR by upto 20\%, compared to standard coincidence measurements, for wrapped 30mm scintillator crystals.
