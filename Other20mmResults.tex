\subsubsection{Other LSO:CeCa 20mm Results}
In figure \ref{fig:centroidposition-20} the same plateau as observed in the 30mm measurements is again seen. In this case the plateau is reached close to 10mm for the wrapped measurements. Again the peak to peak range in the delay peak centroid is comparable to the scintillator crystal length. We can conclude therefore that the shift is predominantly dependent upon the geometry of the scintillator crystal.
