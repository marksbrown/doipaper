\subsubsection{Other LSO:CeCa 20mm Results}
In this section we look at the energy performance of the 20mm scintillator crystals under the three configurations described i nthe previous section. In figure \ref{fig:centroidposition-20} the delay peak position with DOI is seen to possess the same plateau as observed in the 30mm measurements. In this case the plateau is reached close to 10mm for the wrapped measurements. Again the peak to peak range in the delay peak centroid is comparable to the scintillator crystal length. We can conclude therefore that the shift is predominantly dependent upon the geometry of the scintillator crystal.
