\subsection{Decay Length Estimation}
As a brief aside it should be noted that the increase in $\gamma\gamma$ events with increasing scintillator crystal length can be used a method for determining the radiation decay length through the material. For identical scintillator detectors we can calculate the increase in $\gamma\gamma$ event detection as a ratio with respect to number detected at a known value, such that

\begin{equation}
R = \frac{(1-e^{-Z/\lambda})^2}{(1-e^{-5/\lambda})}
\end{equation}
