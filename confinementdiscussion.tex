Measurements were collected for each DOI every 60 or 90 minutes for the wrapped and unwrapped configurations respectively. For good alignment of the scintillator crystal with respect to the central axis of the apparatus, the total number of counts per measurement should be constant as the solid angle coverage of the DOI region as it moves is the same. The only exception to this will be near the ends of the scintillator crystal where the DOI region will edge outside the scintillator crystal and thus lead to a reduced region size and thus fewer measured events.

In figure \ref{fig:confinement} we seen this behaviour for four sets of measurements; namely two identical scintillator crystals at alternating DOI for the wrapped and unwrapped configurations.
