\subsection{30mm Measurements}
Two identical polished Proteus LYSO:Ce $2\times2\times30$mm$^3$ scintillator crystals, which we will refer to as 30A and 30B, are measured using the DOI apparatus at DOI levels at 2.5mm increments between 0 and 30mm alternating between the two scintillator crystals. This is to determine the contribution, if any, of systematic errors introduced by differences in coupling, alignment and surface finish of the crystal within the system. Each measurement is repeated with and without PTFE (Teflon) tape. The Teflon tape covers all faces, bar that in contact with the photodetector, with several tight bound layers to increase adhesion. The two measurements will be referred to as the wrapped and unwrapped configuration respectively. Measurements were collected for each DOI every 60 or 90 minutes for the wrapped and unwrapped configurations respectively. All DOI measurements are performed against a reference detector possessing an LSO:CeCa $2\times2\times5$mm$^3$ scintillator crystal with a CTR of $131\pm4$ps.
