\subsection{30mm Measurements}
\subsubsection{CTR Results}
Two identical polished Proteus LYSO:Ce $2\times2\times30$mm$^3$ scintillator crystals, which we will refer to as 30A and 30B, are measured at DOI values between between 0 and 30mm in 2.5mm increments alternating between the two scintillator crystals. This is to determine the contribution, if any, of systematic errors introduced by differences in coupling, alignment and surface finish. Each measurement is repeated with and without PTFE (Teflon) tape. The PTFE tape covers all faces bar that in contact with the photodetector with several tightly-bound layers to increase adhesion. Measurements with complete wrapping will referred to as the wrapped configuration. Likewise no wrapping is referred to as the unwrapped configuration. Each measurement was taken for 60 or 90 minutes for the wrapped and unwrapped configurations respectively. As in the standard coincidence measurements, the first 5 minutes of data are ignored to ensure temperature stability within the sealed apparatus box.
