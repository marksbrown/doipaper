\subsection{Analysis of Data}
For each measurement data was recorded from the Oscilloscope into raw csv files labelled with the varied parameter and scintillator crystal used in a A vs B fashion. Each measurement produced 7 datafiles, corresponding to different recorded information from the programmed oscilloscope. Where files 1,2 are the maximum energy per event, files 7,8 are the events per period and file 3 is the relative arrival time. The remaining two files correspond to the widths of the NINO signals. These are not used.

The code attached to this paper performs the following tasks : 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Load grouped data into memory
\item Searches for and fits to Gaussian peaks in energy data
\item 
\end{enumerate}
