\subsection{Analysis of Data}
For each measurement data was recorded from the Oscilloscope into raw csv files labelled with the varied parameter and scintillator crystal used in a A vs B fashion. Each measurement produced 7 datafiles, corresponding to different recorded information from the programmed oscilloscope. Where files 1,2 are the maximum energy per event, files 7,8 are the events per period and file 3 is the relative arrival time. The remaining two files correspond to the widths of the NINO signals. These are not used.

The code attached to this paper performs the following tasks : 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Load grouped data into memory
\item Searches for and fits to Gaussian peaks in energy data
\item Searches for events which record only two gamma ray photons
\item Select events matching photopeak and two event criteria
\item Use above to select for true gamma-gamma events only
\item Fit to delay peak. Determine error in fit using BCA bootstrap.
\item Return results
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Data, Tables and Images}
All processed data can be found \href{https://github.com/marksbrown/doipaper/tree/master/processeddata}{here} for each set of parameter - scintillator crystals, configurations and shapes are combined and plotted \& tabulated in the following notebooks :
