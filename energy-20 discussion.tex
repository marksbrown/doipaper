In figures \ref{fig:energyresolution-20} and \ref{fig:lightoutput-20} we see that the energy resolution is poorest at low DOI; this despite the light output being highest at low DOI. The poorer energy resolution is due to the right photopeak FWHM increasing at low DOI. This is due to ...

The improvement in the energy resolution from unwrapped to wrapped is expected due to the corresponding increase in the light output. As the increase in the light output is large when covering the face opposing the photodetector, it is clearly important that in real usage it is ensured that a proper PTFE wrap is in place to maximise timing and energy performance.
