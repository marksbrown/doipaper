\subsection{Standard Coincidence Measurements}
In the standard coincidence apparatus, the two scintillator detectors are placed opposite one another with the source an equal distance between the two. We the first set of results, given in section \ref{sec:standardctr}, we determine the CTR of Proteus LYSO:Ce scintillator crystals of lengths 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30mm. All crystals have the same cross section of $2\times2$mm$^2$. To determine the CTR we subtract the reference detector CTR in quadrature such that



\subsection{Depth Of Interaction Coincidence Measurements}
The apparatus as described in \cite{arron_Meyer_Pauwels_Lecoq_2012} is altered in several respects as shown in \ref{fig:actualsetup}. Firstly the right photodetector is placed within a 3D-printed clamp, shown in figure \ref{fig:actualsetup}, designed to hold the scintillator crystal vertically with respect to the reference detector. Secondly the Na22 source is moved to a 5mm separation distance from the scintillator crystal under investigation. As in the standard apparatus both scintillator crystals are coupled to the Hamamatsu MPPC S10931-050P SiPM photodetectors using Rhorosil 47A optical grease. 

\subsection{Reference Coincidence Measurements}
The reference scintillator crystal, shown on the left of \ref{fig:actualsetup}, is a 2×2×5mm3 Ca-co-doped LSO:Ce wrapping in PTFE tape coupled. Using two identical such crystals the coincidence time resolution was determined using the standard coincidence apparatus, values shown in table \ref{tab:referencevals}. This value is agreement with prior measurement\cite{arron_Meyer_Pauwels_Lecoq_2012}.
