\section{Standard Coincidence Measurements}
We begin by determining the CTR of Proteus LYSO:Ce scintillator crystals of lengths 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30mm using the standard coincidence apparatus. All crystals have the same cross section of $2\times2$mm$^2$. Each measurement took 15 minutes. The full results are given in table \ref{tab:standardctr}.
