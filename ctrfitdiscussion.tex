In table \ref{tab:ctrfitresults} we perform two polynomial fits; namely the zeroth and 1st order. We determine the quality of these fits using $\chi^2$\footnote{I'm tempted to replace these with correlation coefficients} where values close to unity are good fits. $\chi^2_\text{nofit}$ is the reduced chi-squared test for no relationship between the CTR and DOI. $\chi^2_\text{linearfit}$ is the reduced chi-squared test for a linear relationship between the CTR and DOI. In the first instance we see the values are close to unity. Furthermore the error in the intercept$_\text{nofit}$ is larger than the peak to peak (PTP) change in the CTR values, indicating that there is no relationship between the CTR and DOI in all four data sets. Expanding to linear fits the $\chi^2_\text{linearfit}$ values are, on the whole, lower than unity indicating a parameter over specification.
