\label{fig:confinement-20} Three configurations shown for a $2\times2\times20$ mm$^3$ LSO:CeCa scintillator crystal. In this we see that the partially wrapped and wrapped configurations shown good alignment, whereas the unwrapped shows poor. This will result in fewer events being collected and thus a larger error in higher DOI measurements.
