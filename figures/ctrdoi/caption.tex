\label{fig:ctrvsdoi} Coincidence time resolution (CTR in ps) versus the depth of interaction (DOI in mm) for
for two Proteus $2\times2\times30$mm$^3$ LYSO:Ce scintillator crystals in the wrapped and unwrapped configurations. Measurements are alternated with increasing DOI to check for any systematic error introduced by individual scintillator crystals.
