\label{fig:confinement} The number of valid gamma-gamma events recorded with depth of interaction for $2\times2\times30$mm$^3$. A uniform distribution convolved with a Gaussian of standard deviation 1mm is plotted as a dashed black line. This demonstrates the validity of the confinement within the DOI region.
