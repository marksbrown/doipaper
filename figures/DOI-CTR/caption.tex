 \label{fig:doi-ctr} Coincidence apparatus for recording the depth-of interaction (DOI) contribution to the time resolution. This schematic has been drawn to scale to illustrate the confinement region precisely. The left scintillator detector, the reference detector, is set a distance $x_1$ from the $1$\mmc  Na${}_{22}$ source. The right scintillator detector, the one under investigation, is set a distance $x_2$ from the source. The DOI region is altered by translating the right scintillator detector vertically using a precision translation stage. The value $z$ corresponds to the DOI within  the scintillator crystal.
