\label{fig:energyresolution} The energy resolution ($\%$) versus the depth of interaction plotted for two Proteus $2\times2\times30$ mm$^3$ LYSO:Ce scintillator crystals in the unwrapped and wrapped configurations. For a DOI greater than 5 mm, the mean energy resolutions are 16.52$\pm$0.02\% and 13.92$\pm$0.01\% for the unwrapped and wrapped configurations respectively.
