\section{Method}
The coincidence apparatus used in this paper is comprised of two Hamamatsu MPPC S10931-050P SiPM connected to CERN-developed NINO discriminators from which the energy and timing information of individual pulses are collected using a LeCroy DDA 735Zi high-bandwidth oscilloscope. Scintillator crystals are coupled to the SiPM photodetectors using Rhorosil 47A optical grease to improve coupling. Prior to coupling all scintillator crystals are cleaned using methanol. Wrapped scintillator crystals are tightly bound in many layers of Teflon to ensure good coupling between the scintillator crystal and wrap. All scintillator crystals are handled with carbon-tipped tweezers to prevent formation of surface defects which may degrade the scintillator crystal performance. The coincidence apparatus is held within a temperature stable chamber to maintain stability of photodetector performance. Further to this, the first 5 minutes of each measurement is discarded due to any potential contribution of temperature variation. The optimal threshold and bias values of the SiPMs were determined by parameter sweep and are given in table \ref{tab:optimumparam}.

\subsection{Standard Coincidence Measurements}
In the standard coincidence apparatus, the two scintillator detectors are placed opposite one another with the source an equal distance between the two.

\subsection{Depth Of Interaction Coincidence Measurements}
The apparatus as described in \cite{arron_Meyer_Pauwels_Lecoq_2012} is altered in several respects as shown in \ref{fig:actualsetup}. Firstly the right photodetector is placed within a 3D-printed clamp, shown in figure \ref{fig:actualsetup}, designed to hold the scintillator crystal vertically with respect to the reference detector. Secondly the Na22 source is moved to a 5mm separation distance from the scintillator crystal under investigation. As in the standard apparatus both scintillator crystals are coupled to the Hamamatsu MPPC S10931-050P SiPM photodetectors using Rhorosil 47A optical grease. 

\subsection{Reference Coincidence Measurements}
The reference scintillator crystal, shown on the left of \ref{fig:actualsetup}, is a 2×2×5mm3 Ca-co-doped LSO:Ce wrapping in PTFE tape coupled. Using two identical such crystals the coincidence time resolution was determined using the standard coincidence apparatus, values shown in table \ref{tab:referencevals}. This value is agreement with prior measurement\cite{arron_Meyer_Pauwels_Lecoq_2012}.
