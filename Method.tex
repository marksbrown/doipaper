The apparatus as described in \cite{arron_Meyer_Pauwels_Lecoq_2012} is altered in several respects as shown in \ref{fig:actualsetup}. Firstly the right photodetector is placed within a 3D-printed clamp designed to hold the scintillator crystal vertically with respect to the reference detector. Secondly the Na22 source is moved to a 5mm separation distance from the scintillator crystal under investigation. As in the standard apparatus both scintillator crystals are coupled to the Hamamatsu MPPC S10931-050P SiPM photodetectors using Rhorosil 47A optical grease. These are connected to CERN-developed NINO discriminators from which the energy and timing information of individual pulses are collected using a LeCroy DDA 735Zi high-bandwidth oscilloscope.
