\section{Method}
Two Hamamatsu MPPC S10931-050P SiPM are coupled to CERN-developed NINO discriminators. From these the energy and timing information of individual pulses are collected using a LeCroy DDA 735Zi high-bandwidth oscilloscope. A full description of the electronics used can be found in \cite{arron_Meyer_Pauwels_Lecoq_2012}.
