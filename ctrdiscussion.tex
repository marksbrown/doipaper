In figure \ref{fig:ctrvsdoi} the CTR (in ps) versus the DOI (in mm) is plotted for the two configurations. In table \ref{tab:doiresults} the mean CTR values along with the reduced $\chi^2_\text{nofit}$ for fitting the weighted mean is given. It can be seen that there is no relationship between the coincidence time resolution and depth of interaction within error. Next we can see that the CTR of the unwrapped scintillator crystals is poorer by 6\% compared to that of the wrapped measurements. The difference between the two measurements is much smaller than that which we would expect in the standard CTR measurement\cite{r_Paganoni_Pauwels_et_al__2011}\cite{uffray_Jarron_Meyer_Lecoq_2013}
