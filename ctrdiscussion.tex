In figure \ref{fig:ctrvsdoi} the CTR (in ps) with sample, DOI (in (mm) and configuration is given. In table \ref{fig:doitrresults} the mean values for timing and energy performance are given. It can be seen that the CTR of the wrapped samples is superior to the unwrapped by approximately 20ps. The difference between the two CTR measurements, 8\% averaged between the measurements, is much smaller than that which we would expect in the standard CTR measurement. It's seen in [Table IV]\cite{r_Paganoni_Pauwels_et_al__2011} that the difference between wrapped and unwrapped CTR is about 33\%. This implies that knowledge of the DOI can reduce the CTR by 20\% within the standard coincidence apparatus.
