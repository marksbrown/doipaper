\section{Reference Measurements}
The reference scintillator crystal, shown on the left of \ref{fig:actualsetup}, is a 2×2×5mm3 Ca-co-doped LSO:Ce wrapping in PTFE tape coupled. Using two identical such crystals the coincidence time resolution was determined using both the standard and DOI coincidence apparatus. The measured values are shown in table \ref{tab:referencevals}. The standard coincidence CTR value is in agreement with prior measurement\cite{arron_Meyer_Pauwels_Lecoq_2012}.
