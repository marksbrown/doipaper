\section{Reference Detector Measurements}
\label{sec:reference}
The reference scintillator crystal, shown on the left of figure \ref{fig:actualsetup}, is a $2\times2\times5$mm$^3$ Ca-co-doped LSO:Ce wrapping in PTFE tape. Using two identical such crystals the CTR was determined using both the standard and DOI coincidence apparatus. The measured values are shown in table \ref{tab:referencevals}. The standard coincidence CTR value is in agreement with prior measurement [Table 2]\cite{uffray_Jarron_Meyer_Lecoq_2014} with a value of 123$\pm$7ps. In this paper the reference detector CTR value is taken as $131\pm4$ps unless otherwise stated.
